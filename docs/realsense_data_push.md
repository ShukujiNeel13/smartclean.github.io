# Data push
This page describes how sensor data can be sent to your web service.

## How it works
1. Given a valid URL to an available web service, we can enable data from any devices onboarded on our platform 
to be sent in batches to this service.
   
2. Here, batch of data means a collection of data objects, where each object represents a data point.

3. We recommend securing your web service with some form of authentication.
   1. So that only your authorised clients (such as our data push service) can make requests to it.
   2. Authentication schemes that our data push service can currently work with:
      1. Basic (based on username, password)
      2. OAuth (with grant type: client credentials)
      3. OAuth (with grant type: refresh token)
      4. Authentication for _Azure Event Hub_ or _AWS IoT_ 
   
4. Please ensure the protocol used for the web service is HTTP secure 
   - i.e HTTPS instead of HTTP


## Requirements to enable data push
1. Valid data sources (sensors in this case) correctly installed and activated in your desired locations.
   1. Any sensors from any provider or manufacturer that comply with, and are onboarded on our platform will work.
   2. For information about correct installation and configuration of our existing suite of sensors, please visit 
   [our help centre page for RealSense.](https://help.smartclean.io/support/solutions/84000146848)
2. Valid HTTPS URL to your available web service.


## Request data and sensor data format
1. The web service will receive in the **body of the request** a _utf-8 encoded batch of JSON serialized data objects_.
   1. Data from any sensor is sent as soon as it is received.
   2. Batch means the data is inside a list / array structure (i.e. within square brackets: [])
   3. This batch is encoded into a bytes string using the scheme: utf-8 
   4. JSON serialized data object means the data object is converted to a string (text) using JSON
2. All data objects in the batch follow the general data format described in our 
[sensor data page](https://www.docs.smartclean.io/realsense_sensor_data.html#general-data-format)
3. The custom attributes for each type of sensor are described in respective child page of this sensor data page.
   - You can navigate to the child page for desired sensor slot type using the left navigation bar or 
table of contents at the bottom of that page.
4. The authentication scheme required by the web service should be notified to us in order to make the requests
with the respective authentication correctly.

## How to understand or use this data
Following are the steps to properly extract and process the data for appropriate use.
1. Get data from body of the request
   - This is a bytes string encoded using the scheme: utf-8
2. Decode this bytes string using the same encoding scheme (utf-8)
   1. This gives you a usable text
   2. This is the desired data batch.
3. De-serialize each string in the batch using JSON
4. Each string becomes a data object from which you can extract desired attributes.

## Example of using data:
A small subset of the actual data is described in this example.

1. You receive below data in body of request to your web service, which is an array of stringified sensor data payloads:

```
["{\"t\":\"20220602120301\",\"DevType\":\"SMARTCLEAN#ODRDTR_BATT_V1\"}","{\"t\":\"20220602120301\",\"DevType\":\"SMARTCLEAN#ODRDTR_BATT_V1\"}"]
```

2. If using *python*, decode this using utf-8, you get:

```
["{"t":"20220602120301","DevType":"SMARTCLEAN#ODRDTR_BATT_V1"}","{"t":"20220602120301","DevType":"SMARTCLEAN#ODRDTR_BATT_V1"}"]
```

3. De-serialize/Unmarshal each string in this batch using JSON
    1. Unmarshalling the first string in the batch we get:
       ```
          {"t":"20220602120301","DevType":"SMARTCLEAN#ODRDTR_BATT_V1"}
       ```
   2. Unmarshalling the second string in the batch to get::
       ```
       {"t":"20220602120302","DevType":"SMARTCLEAN#UM"}
       ```
   3. Each object contains various attributes, which can be used as described in our sensor data pages.
      1. These attributes are described in the main and child pages for 
      [sensor data](https://www.docs.smartclean.io/realsense_sensor_data.html).
      2. In this example:
         1. Value of "DevType" indicates what is the slot type of the sensor / device.
         2. Value of "t" is the timestamp in the string format: *YYYYMMDDHHmmss* that is local to the timezone
       (which is indicated in attribute: "Region")
   4. Put these steps in your program to process each data and fulfil desired use cases. 
      - Examples:
      1. If "count" inside "v" of data from PC Lite device (DevType: SMARTCLEAN#UM), 
      crosses a certain maximum value, raise an alert that there is high usage.
      2. If value of *amm* inside "v" of data from AQ Lite device crosses a certain maximum value, 
      raise an alert that there is bad smell or high ammonia concentration.
4. Some example use cases for each sensor type are mentioned at bottom each respective child page in
our [sensor data page](https://www.docs.smartclean.io/realsense_sensor_data.html#custom-data-format))
