# Secure casing
**Summary:** All device enclosures are securely sealed (such as using screws and locks)

**Benefit:** Block/prevent access to sensitive parts of the device and allow manual detection of any tampering done.

## Procedure
Part of our device production process.

## More Details:
1. The secure enclosures designed make it very hard for any being or machine to open the casing.
2. Any tampering done with any of the devices (such as trying to pry open the casing) can be easily detected.
   1. This can be done by comparing the actual device with an image of the factory shipped device.

## Examples:
