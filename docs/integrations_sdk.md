# Integration based on using an SDK
Use this option for getting data from our platform by calling functions of an SDK installed in your programming environment.

Pre-requisite:
- To use the SDK, you should have any application or prototype in the corresponding programming language.
- Download, correctly install and use the SDK following the instructions available in the respective SDK.

Our Solution:
SDK for certain programming languages

We currently have an SDK for following languages available as a release in Github:
1. For _Python_, [visit the Github page here](https://github.com/hello-error/PythonSDK)
2. For _Java_, [visit the Github page here](https://github.com/smartclean/smartclean-sdk-java-builds)

Steps for use:
Generally the SDK will have the below steps for usage:
- Download and install the SDK into your application (or just add the SDK folder in your program folder).
- Import the desired service from the SDK in your program.
- Call the desired function in the service to get and use the response.

**Important:** 
There are specific requirements and instructions for each SDK.
- These are described within the SDK (such as in the README file)
- Please carefully follow these instructions to ensure proper and error-free use.   

Outcome:
- Process (and / or store) the responses of these function calls to fulfil your use case.
- Useful for making repeated web requests to our services within your programming environment conveniently.
- Each SDK is optimised for use in its respective programming environment
- Build or enhance your programs by using SDK.
